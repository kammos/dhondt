It minimizes the number of votes that need to be left aside so that the remaining votes are represented exactly proportionally.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    While the inaccuracies introduced by the <em>D&apos;Hondt method</em> are typically small (fractions of a seat) and hard to avoid using any method (fractions of a seat typically can not be assigned), D&apos;Hondt method is unique in that it <strong>consistently promotes larger parties at expense of smaller ones</strong>.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Because of that, fractional innacuracies typically accumulate to large numbers of seats gained/lost if the elections are run throughout multiple voting districts. Similarly, a party with large, but local support can win large amount of seats in national elections.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    As an example, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Spanish_general_election\">2008 Spanish general election</a> party <em>United Left</em> won a single seat with ~960,000 votes, meanwhile <em>Convergence and Union</em> won 10 seats with just ~780,000 votes.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    Another example, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Polish_parliamentary_election\">2015 Polish parliamentary election</a> party Law and Justice gained <strong>51%</strong> of all seats and complete control of the chamber with only <strong>37.6%</strong> votes nationwide. \r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                    This tool aims to simulate elections using the D&apos;Hondt method, hopefully making it&apos;s inaccuracies more widely known and easier to analyze.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </Prose>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"plus\":\"#27ab83\",\"minus\":\"#e12d39\",\"neutral\":\"#1f2933\",\"container\":\"_1oEGY\",\"box\":\"_3CcjM\"};","import s from \"./styles.scss\";\r\n\r\nexport const Prose = ({children, className, style, ...rest}) => {\r\n    return <div className={s.prose} {...rest}>\r\n        {children}\r\n    </div>\r\n}\r\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nexport default {\"plus\":\"#27ab83\",\"minus\":\"#e12d39\",\"neutral\":\"#1f2933\",\"prose\":\"_2pftE\"};"],"names":["About","className","href","Prose","children","rest","style"],"sourceRoot":""}
